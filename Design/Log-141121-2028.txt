Start: 2030
Finish: 1030
Goal:
	Make basic FileSystem artefact client that contacts a server on localhost
	Attempt test run on Debby (start small test set, try all / some while no changes to FS 
Done:
 	Fixed ArtefactsService.Post<ArtefactAddRequest> to use monogo's save instead of insert'
 	
 	
Start: 0310
Finish: 
Goal:
	FS artefact client needs to produce Drive, Directory artefacts and serialize over service
Done:

Current State (0215 20/11/2014)
- First insert into MongoDB via service works
- dupe id exception after that - look into ID semantics for Artefact typeS
