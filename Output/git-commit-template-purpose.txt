  AlmostSerializing                      decb84c Working out server side Mongo
  AspectQueries                          c3774b9 Serializing Artefacts & test disk aspect mostly working (no exceptions). However QueryableResult<>.Count hasn't worked since around making the class generic
  CRUD                                   a8bce6b Cleanup Artefact / Aspect class, focus on initial goal of creating artefacts/aspects and retrieving collections (default expression, all elements)
  DataStrategies                         00a722a Artefact and aspects both persisting to a single collection in Mongo
  Experimental                           c813f92 Rewrote queryables/proxy provider. Should be close to working but infinite recursion crash around Proxy.Execute<>()
  MajorRedesign                          35163ce Started only tiny bit of code cleanup (1-2 files)
  PotentialSuccessLinq                   50a516d Might have successfully serialized linq expressions over service
  QuerySerialization                     d4b431b Most Queries work - not with embedded queryables
